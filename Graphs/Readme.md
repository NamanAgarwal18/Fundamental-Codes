# Graph 

### Following algorithms
1. **DFS** traversal to find if two nodes are connected or not. [Click Here](https://github.com/NamanAgarwal18/Fundamental-Codes/blob/main/Graphs/dfs.cpp)
2. **BFS** traversal to find the path connected the two nodes. [Click Here](https://github.com/NamanAgarwal18/Fundamental-Codes/blob/main/Graphs/dfs.cpp)
3. **Topological Sort** of a **Weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. [Click Here](https://github.com/NamanAgarwal18/Fundamental-Codes/blob/main/Graphs/Shortest%20path%20in%20DAG.cpp)
